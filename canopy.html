            <h6>High Fidelity Mock Ups</h6>
            <p id ="canopy-body-text">With wireframes in place and a defined brand identity, I went on to develop the high fidelity mockups of Canopy along with a clickable prototype for round two of user testing.
This is the first iteration of the Canopy dashboard for the high fidelity mock up.  I didn’t like how the folders at the top didn’t fit in well with the rest of the dashboard. Upon discussing it with my mentor, I decided it was best to change it to the second version.  Overall, I think displaying the folders as simple smaller cards decluttered the dashboard to provide a more organized look, which is ideal.</p>

            <h6>Moving Forward</h6>
            <p id="canopy-body-text">Two key learnings I can take away from this project is: <br><br><b>1) creating a better user survey and research process</b><br><br><b>2) being smarter about designing if Figma and learning how to user components.</b> <br><br> I realized my user survey and the questions I was asking could have been stronger and less vague. As for working in Figma, I neglected to use components which I now realize would have been such a time saver. I also hope for my next project I can conduct a more indepth user testing that would allow me to test for more flows rather than just the few I tested for in this project.  I really enjoyed working on this project and I am definitely looking forward to the next.
