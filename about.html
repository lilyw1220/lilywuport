            <h4>My Creative Journey</h4>
            <h5>How It Started</h5>
              <p id="about-text">Shortly after graduation, I landed my corporate accounting job. Even though the money was good, something just didn’t feel right. I started feeling lost, and I felt the creative flame inside me was slowly burning out.  It wasn’t a good feeling.  I really missed all the design projects I worked on for my industrial design minor. I really missed my college part time job where I taught a children’s drawing class. It was also a job that I gave me a sense of meaning and fulfillment.  I knew I needed to make a change. A quote that really helped me pivot was one from Kanye West. He said “I build things that mean things to people.” This describes perfectly what I want to do career wise. My passion is to connect with others through the design process and create meaningful experiences for people.</p>

              <h5>Finding My Way</h5>
              <p id="about-text">To prove to myself that I could make this transition, I started looking for small design gigs to work on during my free time. I applied and to my surprise I actually landed something! It was a small project for a start-up. The task was to redesign one of their web pages. I worked on the project, and although I did not land the job, I got paid for my work. At that point I realized that a career in design may actually be possible for me. So with the money that I saved up I enrolled in Bloc and began my UX journey and I haven’t looked back. If there is one thing that truly excites me throughout my UX journey, it is: how can we design solutions that will mean something to people and add value to their lives? This is a creative challenge that I am ready to tackle. Got one? Let's get in touch!</p>
