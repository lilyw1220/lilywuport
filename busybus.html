          <p id="canopy-body-text">Design an app for bus riders to see what time their bus is arriving at the current bus stop.  The app should show:<br><br>1) Bus number and terminal name<br><br>2) Show bus arrival time in minutes<br><br>3) Ability to see when the following bus is arriving</p>

              <h6>User Testing Round 1</h6>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">From these wireframes I developed a low fidelity prototype which was used for the first round of usability testing.  It is important to perform usability tests early on in order to identify any issues that users may face.<br><br>Users tests were conducted in person and also through remote testing.<b>Users were asked to complete the following tasks:</b><br><br><b>1) Sign up for a basic account<br>2) Upload file(s)<br>3) Add a tag to a file to organize it</b><br><br>Based on the user testing results, the following changes were made.</p>
              <p id="canopy-body-text"><b>Change made: Removed "Share with Friends and Family" screen.</b></p>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">Users were confused by the share with friends a family screen and its purpose. It posted as a barrier to entry so it was removed. New users now go straight to the dashboard after sign up.</p>

It is vibrant, green, full of leaves and continuously growing. Similarly that is the story for this cloud storage app. The “leaves” in the canopy represent the files, documents, images, and links that are stored in the cloud.  Within the rainforest canopy there are many things going on, such as animals and plants coming together to create a whole ecosystem. Similarly on this cloud storage application, people will share documents and files and come together to collaborate on projects. </p>

              <h6>High Fidelity Mock Ups</h6>
              <p id ="canopy-body-text">With wireframes in place and a defined brand identity, I went on to develop the high fidelity mockups of Canopy along with a clickable prototype for round two of user testing.
    This is the first iteration of the Canopy dashboard for the high fidelity mock up.  I didn’t like how the folders at the top didn’t fit in well with the rest of the dashboard. Upon discussing it with my mentor, I decided it was best to change it to the second version.  Overall, I think displaying the folders as simple smaller cards decluttered the dashboard to provide a more organized look, which is ideal.</p>

              <p id="canopy-body-text">Two key learnings I can take away from this project is: <br><br><b>1) creating a better user survey and research process</b><br><br><b>2) being smarter about designing if Figma and learning how to use components.</b> <br><br> I realized my user survey and the questions I was asking could have been stronger and less vague. As for working in Figma, I neglected to use components which I now realize would have been such a time saver. I also hope for my next project I can conduct a more indepth user testing that would allow me to test for more flows rather than just the few I tested for in this project.  I really enjoyed working on this project and I am definitely looking forward to the next.
