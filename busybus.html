          <p id="canopy-body-text">Due to the addition of new bus routes, there are different buses stopping at the same bus stop.  Bus riders need to know if the approaching bus is the bus they need to get on, or what time their desired bus is arriving at.</h4>

          <p id="canopy-body-text">Design an app for bus riders to see what time their bus is arriving at the current bus stop.  The app should show:<br><br>1) Bus number and terminal name<br><br>2) Show bus arrival time in minutes<br><br>3) Ability to see when the following bus is arriving</p>

              <p id ="canopy-body-text">To convey a feeling of trust and reliability for BusyBus, the main color that will be used is blue.  Users expect accuracy and dependability when they use the public transit app to plan their trip, and blue can help get this message across.  Grey colors will be used for the text.</p>

The basic and clean look of Roboto helps deliver the bus information to the user in a straightforward manner.</p>

The screen that will be mock up is the screen where users will see what bus is arriving and the time it will arrive.  The following are screens of the design progression.</p>

              <h2>Coding the BusyBus Screen</h2>
              <h6>Using HTML & CSS</h6>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">To further move this prototype along, the next step was to translate the design into code.  The overall structure of this code is written semantically to allow for organization and clarity when going through the code.  <b>There are 3 sections for this screen: the header, the bus list, and the bottom navigation bar. The main component showing the arrival time of the buses was coded using list items.</b></p>

              <h2>Next Steps for BusyBus</h2>
              <h6>Moving Forward</h6>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">Some things to consider next is incorporating a map somewhere on the solution screen because this was a high priority tasks that was missed in the process.  In addition, even though the solution screen has an established hierarchy, that can still be pushed further.  For example, having a clearer distinction between buses that are in service versus out of service.  This could be done by completely highlighting the out of service buses section in a muted color to indicate that they are not running.</p>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">Further steps would be to test how users prefer the bus time to show up on the app.  Would users prefer to see the actual arrival time of the bus such as "11:25 am", or would they prefer to see it as what it is currently, in time intervals such as the bus is arriving in "5 min, 20 min".</p>
              <p id="canopy-body-text">These are a few things to consider as the project continues to develop and more users needs come to light through additional rounds of user testing.</p>
